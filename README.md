router with security functio

Hi, this is the message from the author.

So you will need to first run the shell by using the command

command = sudo ./setup-router.sh

after that you have to restart the your machine 

command = sudo reboot

after that using the command to check whether you got the right track or not.

command = sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n

if everything all right, you will getting something like how many packet and how many bytes, if you got the 0 packet and 0 bytes, means you are wrong.
So you may contact me if you feel that you have any problem.n
